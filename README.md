## CrossMint Challenge

Introduction
I created a Megaverse using the code I wrote for this challenge. Megaverses are 2D spaces made up of a variety of astral objects, such as:

Megaverse has many Celestial Oobject of the following types:

- Polyanets
- SoLoons
- Comeths
- Maybe there is more to be discovered????
- Maybe there is blackhole too?
- Maybe there are mre megaverses? Can we map them too???

Together, these components form a stunning and dynamic 2D representation of the Megaverse.
